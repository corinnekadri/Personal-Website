    <p>Hello and welcome! My name is Corinne Kadri. Welcome to my website. I am from NJ, but I attend a boarding school in CT. A few things about me are: I have 2 dogs, I enjoy doing technical theatre, I do art and photography from time to time, and I like to travel (like the picture at the top). Currently I am learning more about computer science and programming . I will be displaying some of my work in my portfolio
